## Design Inspiration

We had a couple of sources of design inspiration for this project. The first can be found [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/8971108-Biometrics-DD-Animation-Series). We liked how a simple black background can really make colors pop, which is necessary for an effective palette-making tool. Second, we were lightly inspired by [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/6437017-Shift-Dashboard-Dark-Mode) and [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/8956943-National-Park-Icons). One of the pain points with making a palette generating application is that there's already a myriad available but all with very similar UIs, so we wanted something slightly different than the standard square holding each color, hence the circles. We liked the combination of circles with squares in the shift dashboard. Finally, we were lightly inspired by a graffiti-tag look for our header, which we also thought tied into our darker theme and background.
